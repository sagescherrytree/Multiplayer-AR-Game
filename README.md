### Rules

But first...
RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN!

I jest.

1. Tap on stars to collect them. The first person to obtain 10 points wins!
2. Star types:
	a. Gold star (+1 point)
	b. Red star: negative penalty (-5 points)
	c. Green star: positive power up (+5 points)
	d. Glowing yellow star: the Golden Snitch! (+150 points, instantly wins the game.)

### Win/Loss Conditions

Upon the first player achieving 10 points, the game will end for all current players. The winner (the first person who achieves 10 points) will receive a victory screen, while the rest of the players will receive a game over screen. After each round, players can choose to restart the game, or return to the Main Menu.
